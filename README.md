Incremental Game (Testing Modular Programming)

Honestly have no idea if creating html / loading scripts through js is gonna work aswell as i think, more just a side project cause i thought it was a fun idea so

Update 1 - Intial commit

Update 1.001 - Tidied up js/css into folders, added update.js for main game loop, added happiness
