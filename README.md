happiness game

free dopamine !!! antesocial.github.io

TO-DO List - (i'm lazy)

- Dark theme / themes ✅ (kinda)

- More notations? (main one's are mixed scientific, maybe logarithm for the weirdos)

- Rework html so its more consistent/works ✅

- Rework css cause i hate how messy it is ✅

- Maybe improve that codefactor, maybe not ✅

- Highlighting when you can buy upgrades ✅

- less clicks, more stuff ✅

- dopamine click bad, make it obsolote after 2 minutes ✅

- game pacing slightly slower maybe? or just add more stuff to compensate

- add more stuff anyways and find a neat way to do it

- maybe switch off decimal.js due to speed over precision but thats not an issue yet ✅

- modular functions so my code doesn't look like a hot plate of tagliatelle ✅ (kinda)

- general facelift ✅ (yessir)
