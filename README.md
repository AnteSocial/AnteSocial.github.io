happiness game

free dopamine !!! antesocial.github.io

TO-DO List - (i'm lazy)

-Dark theme / themes 

- More notations? (main one's are mixed scientific, maybe logarithm for the weirdos)

-Background opacity tings

-Rework html so its more consistent/works 

-Rework css cause i hate how messy it is 

-Maybe improve that codefactor, maybe not 

-Highlighting when you can buy upgrades

-less clicks, more stuff

-dopamine click bad, make it obsolote after 2 minutes

-game pacing slightly slower maybe? or just add more stuff to compensate

-add more stuff anyways and find a neat way to do it

-maybe switch off decimal.js due to speed over precision but thats not an issue yet

-modular functions so my code doesn't look like a hot plate of tagliatelle

-general facelift
