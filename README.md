TO-DO List - (i'm lazy)
-Dark theme / themes 

-Rework html so its more consistent/works 

-Rework css cause i hate how messy it is 

-Maybe improve that codefactor, maybe not 

-Highlighting when you can buy upgrades

-less clicks, more stuff

-game pacing slightly slower maybe? or just add more stuff to compensate

-add more stuff anyways and find a neat way to do it

-modular functions so my code doesn't look like a hot plate of tagliatelle

-general facelift
